# md5
Hardware implementation of the md5 hash function.

## Status
Not completed. Does **NOT** work.


## Introduction
The [hash function md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) is a broken
hash function that shouldn't be used. But sometimes one needs the
implementation of a broken hash function anyway...

Do use this to for example break things like password hashes. Do NOT use
it to protect anything - password hashes for example.


## Implementation
The core is implemented in Verilog.
